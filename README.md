# bloom

Styles for terminal text — colours and effects — and the ANSI escape sequences
that turn them on and off, for [Meadow](https://github.com/meadow-lang/meadow).

This package is a port of Rust's [`anstyle`](https://github.com/rust-cli/anstyle)
1.0.14 and writes exactly the same sequences. Like the crate, it does not
decide whether a terminal can show colour. It only builds the sequences.

## AI disclosure

Bloom is written with AI coding agents: Anthropic's Claude, through Claude Code.
Most of the code, the tests, the documentation and the commit messages in this
repository were written by an agent, under the direction of the project's
author, who decides the design and what goes in. Read it, and rely on it, with
that in mind.

## Install

```sh
meadow add meadow-lang/Bloom
```

## Use

```meadow
use Bloom (style, bold, withFg, Ansi, Red, paint, render, renderReset)

def warning = bold (withFg (Just (Ansi Red)) style)

def main =
  ( paint warning "careful",                           -- "\u{1b}[1m\u{1b}[31mcareful\u{1b}[0m"
    render warning ++ "careful" ++ renderReset warning  -- the same
  )
```

### Colours

A `Color` is one of three kinds:

- `Ansi c`: one of the sixteen `AnsiColor`s, `Black` to `BrightWhite`;
- `Ansi256 n`: a colour from the xterm palette, `n` from 0 to 255;
- `Rgb r g b`: each component from 0 to 255.

`renderFg`, `renderBg` and `renderUnderline` give the sequence that selects a
colour. For the sixteen:

- `bright yes c` makes a colour bright, or plain;
- `isBright` tells which kind it is;
- `ansiIndex` gives its place in the palette;
- `ansiFromIndex` converts back, and is `None` above 15.

### Effects

An `Effect` is one of `Bold`, `Dimmed`, `Italic`, `Underline`,
`DoubleUnderline`, `CurlyUnderline`, `DottedUnderline`, `DashedUnderline`,
`Blink`, `Invert`, `Hidden` and `Strikethrough`. An `Effects` value is a set of
them.

| function | |
|---|---|
| `plain`, `effectSet e`, `effectsOf [e, …]` | build a set |
| `hasEffect`, `containsEffects`, `isPlainEffects` | test one |
| `insertEffects`, `removeEffects`, `setEffects es other enable` | change one |
| `effectsList es` | its effects, in order |
| `renderEffects es` | the sequences that turn them on |
| `effectsDebug es` | `"Effects(BOLD \| ITALIC)"`, as the crate prints it |

### Styles

A `Style` is a record with three optional colours, `fg`, `bg` and `underline`,
and a set of `effects`. To build one:

- start from `style`, which is plain;
- add colours with `withFg`, `withBg` and `withUnderlineColor`;
- set effects with `withEffects`, `addEffects` or `subEffects`, or with the
  shortcuts `bold`, `dimmed`, `italic`, `underlined`, `blink`, `invert`,
  `hidden` and `strikethrough`;
- or begin with `on fg bg`, `onDefault fg` or `styleOfEffects`.

To write one out:

- `render s` turns the style on;
- `renderReset s` turns it off again, and is empty for a plain style;
- `reset` is the bare off sequence;
- `paint s text` wraps `text` in both.

The crate's `Style::underline` is called `underlined` here, so that it is not
confused with the `underline` field.

## How it's made

`src/Color.mw`, `src/Effects.mw` and `src/Style.mw` are hand translations of
the crate's source. **`src/Cases.mw`** is generated test data:

- 3,000 random styles, each with its rendering and its effects combined with
  another set;
- all 256 palette colours converted to the sixteen;
- the sixteen colours brightened, dimmed and set on backgrounds.

Every expected result comes from calling the crate. Run `scripts/generate.sh`
to regenerate; it needs a Rust toolchain.
